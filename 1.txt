Watch out for the rabbit holes! (Bunnies don't seem to share.)\n\nIn the Quack’s Apples app, kids can have as many tries as they need to perfect their route for the getting Quack’s apples to roll into the pond. Quack has an unlimited supply of apples, though there seem to be an unlimited supply of sticks too! By encouraging kids to keep testing and tweaking their designs until they get that apple in the pond, they are practicing the engineering design process integral to scientific thinking.\n\nPlayers can't get rid of the sticks that block the apples from rolling into the pond, but can tap on them to turn them in different directions to create a path for the apples to roll into the water. Once they get it, the next setup will be a little harder. \n\nThe PEEP and the Big Wide World Trash Stash app from WGBH was produced by WGBH, the producers of PEEP and the Big Wide World, with additional development work by CloudKid. The animated series PEEP and the Big Wide World gives wings to the innovative idea of teaching science to preschoolers.

"description":"Rowmote lets you seamlessly control audio, video, and presentation applications on your Mac from your iOS device.\n\nYou love the remote control which came with your Mac - so simple yet elegant, with easy control of Front Row, iTunes, Quicktime, DVD Player, Keynote, and more.\n\nOr, your Mac didn’t come with a remote control or doesn’t even have an infrared port. Buying a remote control, from Apple or a third party, would carry a significant cost!\n\nYou carry your iPhone or iPod Touch wherever you go... so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer?  Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote!  Rowmote is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! By tapping the Apps button, you get bonus abilities, switching between controlled programs, toggling the iTunes Visualizer, and more. Rowmote will even wake sleeping Macs.\n\nFEATURES\n\n - Control your Mac over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.\n\n - Functions just like the hardware Apple Remote Control in:\n• Adobe Lightroom\n• Airfoil Video\n• Amarra\n• Aperture\n• BBC iPlayer\n• Beamer\n• Boxee\n• Decibel\n• DVD Player\n• Ecoute\n• eyeTV 3.x\n• Firefox\n• Front Row\n• Hulu Desktop\n• iPhoto\n• iTunes\n• Keynote ‘08 & later\n• kJams Pro\n• Kodi\n• Last.fm\n• Logic\n• Microsoft Powerpoint ‘04 & later\n• mPlayer\n• Movist\n• OpenOffice Impress\n• Preview\n• PandoraBoy\n• PandoraJam\n• PandoraOne Desktop\n• Photos\n• Plex, Plex Home Theater, & Plex Media Player\n• Quicktime\n• Rdio\n• Safari\n• Skim\n• Songbird\n• Spotify\n• Squire\n• The Tube\n• VLC\n• xbmc (Xbox Media Center)\n\n- SWITCH: Access your Mac’s Dock, launching & switch between all controllable applications on the Mac, toggle the iTunes visualizer, and more. Order & display customizable.\n\n - Click-and-hold works just like on the physical remote in applications; for example, holding the right button fast-forwards, while a single click is ‘next’. This is a feature no other iPhone remote control I know of does properly!\n\n- Sleep on demand; wake the Mac automatically\n- Pause the music or video automatically when you answer a call on your iPhone\n- Proximity sensor support to automatically turn the screen off if the device is face-down\n- Secure authentication\n- Optional dark interface\n- Connect via WiFi or Bluetooth (Bluetooth requires Personal Hotspot Bluetooth tethering)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n • Mac OS X 10.4.0 or later.\n • Mac: The free Rowmote Helper program must be running on the Mac to be controlled. Download at www.rowmote.com. Some features require later versions of Mac OS X.\n • Apple TV: 1st and 2nd generation may see www.rowmote.com/atv for potential compatibility.\n\nRowmote is a steal!

"description":"** App Store Best of 2014 **\n** Apple Design Award 2014 Winner **\n\nGet in the know in no time.\n \nYahoo News Digest provides a definitive summary of all the important, need-to-know news. Digests are delivered twice a day - once in the morning and once in the evening. All the top stories are summarized and presented with the key information that you need to stay on top of what’s happening.\n\nEach story is created from multiple sources to present the essential bits and pieces of information, known as “Atoms”. Atoms are key quotes, images, videos, stock tickers, maps, infographs, and Wikipedia excerpts among others. These atomic units provide a unique context to the news. Our stories are both algorithmically and hand curated to ensure high quality, and come with a textual summary.\n\nIn addition, we have extended this paradigm for the Apple Watch to deliver top-of-the-hour news bulletins.  These bulletins are designed with the Yahoo News Digest's minimalist and modernists attitude.  A bulletin begins with a beautiful, geometric poster which signifies the hour using Roman numeral accents, color and diagonal accents. The view is simple with just a graphic and concise headline. The bulletin itself is composed three simple but important screens. We offer the user a two sentence microsummary, a visual piece of information we call an \"atom\" eg map/stock ticker/stat, and then the ability for the user to speed read further information.\n\nYahoo News Digest makes your reading experience comprehensive, effortless, and complete, and is customized for both iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. If you get your News Digest on an iPad, you’ll also enjoy a weekly Katie Couric video show, the ability to customize when you receive your news and, in the US edition, extra news categories called Sections which include atomized stories on a whole range of topics.\n\nWe are committed to building the best mobile experience and are interested in your feedback.\n\nLet us know your thoughts here: https://yahoo.uservoice.com/forums/236000", "bundleId":"com.yahoo.atom", "artistId":281970157, "artistName":"Yahoo", "genres":["News", "Utilities"], "price":0.00, "releaseDate":"2014-01-01T01:13:13Z", "primaryGenreName":"News", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2016-10-31T22:02:32Z", "releaseNotes":"- Temporarily removing the Apple Watch experience while we work on some under-the-hood improvements\n- bug fixes and performance improvement", "sellerName":"Yahoo!
